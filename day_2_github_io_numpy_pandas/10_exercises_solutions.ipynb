      "The data set for this year's Cup has been generously provided by the\n",
      "Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA).  PVA is a not-for-profit\n",
      "organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with\n",
      "spinal cord injuries or disease.  With an in-house database of over 13\n",
      "million donors, PVA is also one of the largest direct mail fund\n",
      "raisers in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Participants in the '98 CUP will demonstrate the performance of their\n",
      "tool by analyzing the results of one of PVA's recent fund raising\n",
      "appeals.  This mailing was sent to a total of 3.5 million PVA donors\n",
      "who were on the PVA database as of June 1997.  Everyone included in\n",
      "this mailing had made at least one prior donation to PVA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mailing included a gift (or \"premium\") of personalized name &\n",
      "address labels plus an assortment of 10 note cards and envelopes.  All\n",
      "of the donors who received this mailing were acquired by PVA through\n",
      "similar premium-oriented appeals such as this.\n",
      "\n",
      "One group that is of particular interest to PVA is \"Lapsed\" donors.\n",
      "These are individuals who made their last donation to PVA 13 to 24\n",
      "months ago.  They represent an important group to PVA, since the\n",
      "longer someone goes without donating, the less likely they will be to\n",
      "give again.  Therefore, recapture of these former donors is a critical\n",
      "aspect of PVA's fund raising efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, PVA has found that there is often an inverse correlation\n",
      "between likelihood to respond and the dollar amount of the gift, so a\n",
      "straight response model (a classification or discrimination task) will\n",
      "most likely net only very low dollar donors.  High dollar donors will\n",
      "fall into the lower deciles, which would most likely be suppressed\n",
      "from future mailings.  The lost revenue of these suppressed donors\n",
      "would then offset any gains due to the increased response rate of the\n",
      "low dollar donors.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, to improve the cost-effectiveness of future direct\n",
      "marketing efforts, PVA wishes to develop a model that will help them\n",
      "maximize the net revenue (a regression or estimation task) generated\n",
      "from future renewal mailings to Lapsed donors.\n",
