When you are processing text, you may want to extract a **substring** of some predictable structure: a phone number, an email address, or something more specific to your research or task.  You may also want to clean your text of some kind of junk: maybe there are repetitive formatting errors due to some transcription process that you need to remove.\n",

Every list has an `.index()` method, and you can find the corresponding index number in the list for a given element passed to the method as an argument.  So if I wanted *where* in `patterns` was the regex `r'[^ABC]'`, I could use `patterns.index(re.compile(r'[^ABC]'))`.
